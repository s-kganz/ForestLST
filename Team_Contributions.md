Feedback from Keenan:
This project grew out of my dissertation research, so we began the quarter with a fair amount of data and code already available. My goal was to bring Miko up to speed on what was already done and make sure that the code I had written was reproducible. We encountered a fair amount of challenges getting Miko's environment set up. In the future, it would be wise to add a Dockerfile to this repository so we can add new collaborators. Nevertheless, Miko was able to get similar results as I did for the fully connected model on the CA dataset. I think I could have done a better job setting goals for the quarter. It seemed like every time I spoke with Miko we went in a completely different direction. Overall, I think we should be proud of what we accomplished this quarter!

Feedback from Miko:
I learned a lot from Keenan and this project! I did not have very much previous experience with machine learning or collaborative GitHub projects, but Keenan was very knowledgeable and always happy to help when I was stuck. I was able to gain familiarity with adjusting python environments and kernels, as well as learn about various machine learning tools and problem solving with code. Overall, I'm grateful to have had Keenan as a mentor, and I'm impressed with the project so far!
