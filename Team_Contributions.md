Feedback from Keenan:
This project grew out of my dissertation research, so we began the quarter with a fair amount of data and code already available. My goal was to bring Miko up to speed on what was already done and make sure that the code I had written was reproducible. We encountered a fair amount of challenges getting Miko's environment set up. In the future, it would be wise to add a Dockerfile to this repository so we can add new collaborators. Nevertheless, Miko was able to get similar results as I did for the fully connected model on the CA dataset. I think I could have done a better job setting goals for the quarter. It seemed like every time I spoke with Miko we went in a completely different direction. Overall, I think we should be proud of what we accomplished this quarter!
